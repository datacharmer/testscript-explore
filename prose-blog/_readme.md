title: The Data Charmer
description: Thoughts and notes on software development, databases, and QA

This is my new blog page. The [old one](https://datacharmer.blogspot.com) required too much low-level maintenance (either writing directly in HTML or converting Markdown). This one is very simple, allowing me to modify directly the Markdown text.

See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/datacharmer) for more up-to-date work.
